        <h2>Public assistance indicators</h2>
<p>This page covers indicators related to whether Hartford area residents receive public assistance through various programs. </p>

<h2>Data and limitations</h2>

<p>Data on public assistance programs is available nationally through the Census Bureau, primarily the American Community Survey, and within Connecticut from the Department of Social Services. </p>

<h2>What do we already know?</h2>

<p>Indicators of cases and recipients of public assistance are used in a few reports. </p>

<h3>Local</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ctfairhousing.org/people-place-and-opportunity-report/">CT Fair Housing Center Opportunity Mapping</a> (developed with the Kirwan Institute at Ohio State) includes the population on public assistance as a factor in their opportunity index, using Census data.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?a=2998&amp;Q=490946">Population Results Working Group</a> includes the percent of all households receiving SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) using data from DSS.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other relevant efforts</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.futurefundneo.org/whatmatters">What Matters to Metros</a> includes data on the percentage of households receiving SSI, cash assistance, and food stamps, via Census data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample results</h2>

<p>The census asks about <a href="http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_11_5YR_B19058&amp;prodType=table">usage of public assistance</a>, defined as foot stamps or SNAP. </p>

<p>The sample results below are for all towns in Hartford and Tolland Counties for convenience. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1"> </p>

<p>Since the data is drawn from the ACS, there are margins of error associated with the values, which can be large for small towns. </p>

<p>Hartford has about twice the population on public assistance of the next highest town in the region, which itself has almost twice as high a rate as the next town. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-2.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2"> </p>

<p>The rates of public assistance usage track closely to poverty levels. The chart below compares poverty levels to usage of public assistance rates (on a log scale, to accomodate the large gaps between towns). </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-3.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3"> </p>

<p>The census data on public assistance can also be looked at by neighborhood (for 5-year estimates). Neighborhood maps for the region confirm the high concentration of recipients of public assistance in Hartford. </p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-4.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4"> </p>

<p>DSS releases data on cases and recipients for HUSKY, Medicaid, TANF and foot stamps, published via the <a href="http://ctdata.org/catalog">CTData portal</a>.</p>

<p>Aggregate data for the region shows increases in food stamps usage from 2008 to the present.</p>

<p><img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-5.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5"> </p>

<p>Looking at data by town shows that most of the increases have come through Hartford, although with higher numbers of cases also many other towns - East Hartford, Bloomfield and Manchester especially. </p>
